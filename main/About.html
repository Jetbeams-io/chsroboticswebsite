      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class="white">Our team is a mix of all grades of Carroll High School students. Most of the students are also involved in Carroll's PLTW courses and are looking to gain more experience in the field of engineering and its components. A main focus of our team is teamwork and how that is incorporated into a group setting when proposed with a problem to solve. We also encourage strong communication, peer-to-peer interactions, and leadership as pertaining to engineering.  We also facilitate a wide variety of interests. Some students join just for the VEX interaction and experience, some join for other purposes that spin off our activities. Being involved in a robotics team can provide a background in basic automation, manufacturing processes, programming, industrial design, fabrication, and more, which can be invaluable to team members in their future. </p></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><p class="white">One way we take the VEX platform to the next step is not to use VEX structural pieces, but to instead fabricate our own chassis pieces in Carroll's workshop. In previous years, we have had entirely wooden robots, which allowed for faster movement speed because they were lighter. We have also made chassis hoods completely out of plexiglass, making the robot transparent. We also added LED's to make it look cooler. This fabrication of body pieces can be both performance enhancing as well as cosmetically enhancing. Other materials used have been sheet metal, aluminum, a white board, plastic, 3-D printed parts, and more. This is a valuable aspect for team members because it gives them a chance to gain experience in a workshop and using machinery that they may have not had access to previously.</p></div>

                <div class="collapsible-header waves-effect waves-effect">Drive Code and Programming</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><p class="white">Another innovation we pride ourselves in is our holonomic and omni-directional drive control, as well as having well-written and efficient code. A few years back, we developed our first holonomic drive robot, one of the first in the league. This allowed the robot to move in any direction without turning, which was very beneficial in that year's game mode.  This year we are using mechanum wheels and using an omni-directional drive, as we did last year. This provides the same effect as holonomic, but it's a bit easier to code. </p></div>
